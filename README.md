I developed a sorting puzzle as a web app. The challenge is to reorder the jumbled up verb conjugations of a Sanskrit word assigning them to their correct person. One can test their knowledge of Sanskrit grammar in this game. The player sees the tense / mood of the verb, the class of the verb stem as clues. This is supported both on desktop and handheld devices.  

Try this game on a desktop for best results.
